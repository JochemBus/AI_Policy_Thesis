In every field of technology,  commerce and trade, and jobs, the Chinese need the Americans much more than the Americans need the Chinese.

 One thing I don't know about the transgender is about the hormones they take - do they have to take them daily? What happens to their physical and mental state if they have to go without them for a long time?

If a person is dependent on drugs to maintain physicality or mentality, generally they are not considered fit for military service.

He can be ambiguous when speaking about Church teaching, tending more toward platitudes than clarity, and he's insensitive and awkward when speaking about women. 

On the plus side, he understands and articulates what's essential and urgent about the Church (mercy, solidarity with the poor and suffering, acting as Christ in the world) and what's excess baggage that should be jettisoned (triumphalism, cancerous clericalism, rigid legalism over compassion.)

Thank you for writing this article. Of course, the identity of the Church's priests is a very important thing: they are first and foremost servants of God. What I can't understand, then, is why sexual orientation need be an important aspect of that priestly identity: you seem to agree, insofar as a man should not be turned away from seminary based on sexual orientation.

At the same time, would the irrelevance of sexual orientation in selecting priests not also carry over into the active lives of the priests? It is perfectly irrelevant that a man is attracted sexually to this or that category of people when that man is a priest. Hence, there is no meaningful classification of ""gay priests"" or ""straight priests"", but only priests as such.

A lot of people get confused about this. They think a thing is magisterial because the Pope says so, but really it's the other way around: Popes tend to say things that they know are magisterial teaching; because Popes are usually knowledgeable about Church teaching and committed to its promulgation.

Good news is that science will likely get us onside, for all the right reasons.  Within the next 25 years, electric cars will replace gasoline engines not because climate scientists say it must happen or governments legislate it, but because they reach the point that they are cleaner, faster, better, and cheaper to run and maintain.  Same with solar electrical generation vs coal.

We in the ""high"" church denominations certainly believe it is a sacrifice but one of praise and thanksgiving wherein we offer ourselves, our souls and bodies, imperfect as we are, to unite in the sacrament so that He may live in us and we in Him.

I agree with you, but I might take it one step further here.  I think where the church has gotten itself tangled up is in the transition between how jesus lived, and the concept of ""commands"" of or by Jesus.
