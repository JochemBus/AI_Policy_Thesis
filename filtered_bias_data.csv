In every field of technology,  commerce and trade, and jobs, the Chinese need the Americans much more than the Americans need the Chinese.

 One thing I don't know about the transgender is about the hormones they take - do they have to take them daily? What happens to their physical and mental state if they have to go without them for a long time?

If a person is dependent on drugs to maintain physicality or mentality, generally they are not considered fit for military service.

He can be ambiguous when speaking about Church teaching, tending more toward platitudes than clarity, and he's insensitive and awkward when speaking about women. 

On the plus side, he understands and articulates what's essential and urgent about the Church (mercy, solidarity with the poor and suffering, acting as Christ in the world) and what's excess baggage that should be jettisoned (triumphalism, cancerous clericalism, rigid legalism over compassion.)

Thank you for writing this article. Of course, the identity of the Church's priests is a very important thing: they are first and foremost servants of God. What I can't understand, then, is why sexual orientation need be an important aspect of that priestly identity: you seem to agree, insofar as a man should not be turned away from seminary based on sexual orientation.

At the same time, would the irrelevance of sexual orientation in selecting priests not also carry over into the active lives of the priests? It is perfectly irrelevant that a man is attracted sexually to this or that category of people when that man is a priest. Hence, there is no meaningful classification of ""gay priests"" or ""straight priests"", but only priests as such.

A teaching on the subject of faith or morals is magisterial if it has been universally and constantly taught by all of the Popes and the bishops in communion with them. This means universal in time as well as in place. What has been consistently taught since the time of the Apostles is not changeable.

A lot of people get confused about this. They think a thing is magisterial because the Pope says so, but really it's the other way around: Popes tend to say things that they know are magisterial teaching; because Popes are usually knowledgeable about Church teaching and committed to its promulgation. 

A magisterial teaching doesn't suddenly become unmagisterial just because a Pope is confused or forgets or misspeaks or has an inept translator. If one of those things happens, a bishop or theologian nearby is expected to call it to his attention.",0,0,0,0,0

If death is the consequence of original sin, this suggests that she was subject to it and the entire messy human experience like the rest of us.

I agree with you, but I might take it one step further here.  I think where the church has gotten itself tangled up is in the transition between how jesus lived, and the concept of ""commands"" of or by Jesus.

That's certainly true in college admissions, financial aid, government jobs, the military, and the corporate world.

It was also much influenced by the culture in which it was established and grew as it was by what Jesus actually said and did.
