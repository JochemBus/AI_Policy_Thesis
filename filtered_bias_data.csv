I sometimes wonder if young people like Soh get confused by early TV, which was heavily censored and didn't reflect the cultural reality of sexuality.  Married couples on TV slept in separate beds, but real people didn't.  A more accurate reflection of the times was found in movies, where unmarried couples often did engage in affairs without shame.  Even Grace Kelly's character spent the night with her boyfriend Jimmy Stewart (Rear Window, 1954), and Kelly was the epitome of an all-American ""good girl.""",0,0,0,0,0

5498471,"This type of response is common whether we are talking about child sexual abuse, rape of an adult or any type of sex crime.  Sex offenses are so violating to the soul and the sense of integrity, that many people go into a state of denial just thinking about it.  The responses: ""this was a post-pubertal teenager, not a child, this is a gay issue, not an abuse issue,"" ""She was probably 17 and he thought she was 18 because she seemed mature,"" ""She was asking for it by getting drunk and wearing a mini-skirt,"" and on and on and on.  The ideas all come down to an inability to internalize the gross horror of these crimes for the victims.  I've worked with victims of child sexual abuse and adult sexual violence and I know that empathy ends up feeling horrible: sleepless nights, nausea, spiritual doubts, gnawing anger.  But the human thing to do is imagine, really internalize, how awful it must be for the victims, instead of psychologically protecting oneself through these denial mechanisms.",0,1,0,0,0

Two questions must be answered about wealth: how is it acquired/generated, and how is it used.  The sinful generation of wealth might include such things as theft, drug trafficking, exploiting employees, and cutting health care funding to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.  You cannot achieve good ends with wicked means.  There are many acceptable uses of wealth that has been generated ethically, but hoarding it or lavishing it upon oneself are not among them.

(1) Increasingly there are explanations for some events labeled as supernatural. Brain research provides clues. *""Out-of-body"" experiences can be duplicated by brain stimulation. *Some of the Biblical descriptions of ""visions and messages from a god"" are similar to typical epileptic seizures (seeing white light, auditory hallucinations, etc). *""Returning from the dead"" is now being examined with attention to the various phases through which a body dies. Dying is is a series of shut-downs and can sometimes be reversed before the actual final closure. Therefore, a recovery is not a ""return-from-the-dead"" ... because the death never occurred.

(2) The burden of proof lies with the claimant of the supernatural belief - not the skeptic who questions. Opinions are not proof. Supernatural believers need to ask better questions. Evidence will rule. Wait and see.",0,0,0,0,0

On the other hand, if you look at the numbers of violations as a proportion of the number of people in each group *already on probation/parole*, blacks are only 1.2/1.4 times more likely than whites to have probation/parole violations, respectively. 

Of course, this is reconciled by noting that the proportions of the black population on probation and parole are, respectively, 3.4 and 5.5 times the corresponding proportions in the white population.

They tend to insist on having privileges they do not deserve, such as demanding to have a say in the operation of a political party that they refuse to be a part of.

There is also need for more grassroots education of our fellow black South Africans that immigrants do not contest identity with them; they should just allow us the little breathing space afforded by the legal stay we have obtained. Reason is that this brash and unpleasant display of unfriendliness by the black locals towards immigrants at hospitals and some other government agencies is unfortunate. Imagine a hospital where they make you feel less human just because you are an immigrant even with ID? You are even scared to submit yourself to some nurses when you perceive their hostile attitude towards you just because you are an immigrant. They openly discriminate against you because you are one nonentity from God-knows-where and should not be treated with dignity.

I'm constantly surprised to hear other the views of other men....if your point were true then I wouldn't be surprised at all...my knowledge of my marriage (which again is only one-half of one marriage) doesn't seem to aid me that much in understanding other marriages.

After a teenager burned a makeshift cross on the lawn of an African-American couple, the St. Paul Bias Motivated Crime Ordinance—which prohibited symbols that ""[arouse] anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender""—came into effect. In a unanimous ruling written by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held that the ordinance was excessively broad.

  The female victims, on the other hand, were terribly emotionally/psychologically damaged by the molestation they had suffered.  It's a huge counseling/therapy task to help a girl reconstruct her self-image and develop the ability to have meaningful relationships with men after such victimization.

There are many reasons why the medieval development of the altar as wall with a tabernacle as its center piece was not fortuitous. 

The most important has to do with our conception of the Eucharist as PRIMARILY (1) sacred food and drink, or (2) an object of adoration. 

The essence of Eucharist in scripture is sacred food. Jesus confected the Eurcharist at the Last Supper at the dinner table, and commanded us to both eat and drink. For most of the first thousand years, our churches faithfully conveyed that original divine intent with an altar that was instantly recognizable as a dinner table, to which bread and wine were brought, and from with the body and blood of Christ was distributed as sacred food and drink in the form of bread and wine. The original scriptural word that was adopted for a church building was ""ekklesia,"" which means ""gathering"" and which came to be understood as the ""place of gathering.""

I like it. Two incidents in one day reported here on SF of people reacting to the encroaching menace of islam'.

First, the guy who tore up the koran, and now this warrior who defended American cultural norms. Are we seeing the beginning of an uprising against the plague of islam, an uprising which will spread like wildfire into white lands in Europe? Hell, I hope so.

I never agree with Cokie Roberts, who treated Sr. Dianna Ortiz as a liar. Roberts is really a Republican and thinks as one, especially where money and supremacy are the issues. She may be subtle about it but Roberts is as pompous as Glendon and Peggy Noonan.
Let's not forget that our church is still very anti female and likely will always be so. The church is very Republican- like and has always been that way. That is also very unlikely to change. Pope Francis may be less so but the American Catholic prelates are very unlikely to ever be less anti-female. It just seems to be in their DNA. I think a lot of them are crippled in that way. It sure seems to be a Freudian-like mindset. There also seems to be a narcissistic component and a male fear like component to a great many of them.

Actually, what I posted is FULLY rational dialogue.

Your are implying that BEFORE a Canadian express objection to, say, official restrictions or motions on abortion supported by a group of Roman Catholic activists, that Canadian MUST FIRST read and study and scrutinize the content of the Roman Catholic Bible, the ancient text the mentioned activists embrace and follow.

Hello?

Your demand is silly and irrational. Canadians have the right to oppose Ottawa moves on abortion without learning the religious doctrines dear to other Canadians. Indeed, Canadians have the right to be in a situation where they could not care less what the ancient written scrolls are all about that some Canadians follow religiously.

Hey, if the priests are 'not in the know'----for sure the laity ---who are 'poorly formed [doctrinally or theologically].

It was widely speculated at the time, and Pope Benedict has since confirmed, that his inability to tame the Curia at least contributed to Benedict's decision to resign (see article referenced below). Pope John Paul II showed little interest in wrestling with the curial beast.  The ancient Roman axiom, ""Popes pass; the curia remains"" points to the intransigence of the curia. In his remarks today, the Pope names the problem he was elected to address and the obstacles he faces; but he also, in a wonderful display of candor and transparency, names the principles that guide him in doing this work.

The secular world, pretty much “instinctively,” without any reference to the Aristotelian origins of this method of reasoning, accepts that actualizing one’s sexual orientation in sexual activity without harming anyone is a morally positive activity, in EXACTLY the same way scholastic philosophy would deal with any instinct. Therefore, I think one can confidently assume that had the scholastics, including the great Thomas, known what we know today about sexual orientation, they would have reached the same conclusions about homosexuality as today’s youth. And had that happened, then the conclusion about homosexual activity we would have inherited from them would have allowed the Church to lead moral reflection on homosexual ACTIVITY as it had lead reflection on homosexual ORIENTATION",0,1,0,0,0

A supporter of the Israeli far-right and its racist, criminal policies.

Since such people help to perpetuate the illegal occupation and colonization of Palestinian land and the resulting conflict that poses the only real threat to Israelis as well as Palestinians, they are arguably ANTI-Israel, and this is an important distinction to make.

 “the Jewish state”

The Zionist military state of Israel. Referring to it the way its far-right extremists demand only highlights the inexcusable bias of our mass media, which has also helped to perpetuate this injustice for decades.

This is the most blatant, longest-running injustice of our time, and anyone who supports human rights has a duty to speak out & stand against it.

All it would really take to end this is for the US to end its defense of Israel's crimes. The Palestinians have already made round after round of concessions, receiving nothing in return but continued Israeli intransigence and brutality.",0,0,1,0,0
821800,"The probability is that most older divorced and remarried couples know that their union is adulterous and would not presume to come up for Holy Communion.
 Since Vatican II almost everyone goes to receive Communion regardless of whether they are in a state of grace or not. Such a situation prompted a bishop or cardinal to marvel (sarcastically, of course) that it was good to see so many members of the congregation in a 'state of grace'.
I imagine that it it could be quite galling to discover that one's EEM  who is distributing  communion or the deacon's wife is actually on the pill and yet you, as a divorced and remarried, cannot receive the Sacrament. This situation is by no means hypothetical, believe me. I did know an EEM who let it slip that she was on the pill.

Bill,
For several times in the past the heresy of Perfectionism was pushed into the SDAC, by different agents. They never succeeded because the Church always expunged the false teaching quite quickly.

What we are witnessing now is the same heresy being presented under the disguise of a fancy name - LGT! It's bad that so many people appear unacquainted with the heresy and are not recognizing it in he LGTarian movement.

What is worse this time though is that there has been no word, absolutely none from the top administration to denounce this heresy. I am personally persuaded that Ted Wilson actually supports it; which means that this time the LGTarians (aka ""perfectionists) were able to infiltrate the Church's barracks to the top of the administrative pyramid.

More than anything else, the LGT heresy is the biggest danger threatening our Church.",0,0,0,0,0

If  a nation can defend it borders and territorial claims then it has the right to say who enters and who leaves those borders as long as the determination of who stays and goes is within its laws.

I for one can understand the plan of building a wall to control who enters and who leaves and simultaneously determine who stays and who goes.

What I learned was: Assad himself is probably not a monster, but a weak man co-opted by the people his father left in government.  Some of the conflict is based on religious sectarianism and memories of the slaughter of Islamic Brotherhood supporters back in the '80s.  The rebels would be far worse than Assad if they won.  

And the blasted Americans and the West armed those rebels because they wanted Assad out, because of Syria's historic association with Russia and enemies of Israel.

The question is not whether grace can overcome the need to Marry again but whether it has to. If the Church has been proof texting Mark inaccurately, which on its fact condemnds divorce and remarriage as a single act (i.e. divorce not and but to marry another), then there is no need for grace.
Not adultery if you were the one who was dumped and then remarried. As for gays, if they were born that way, married homosexaul relations cannot be sinful. The sinful act of sodomy was pederaasty.

Our church's system of government has no affinity to the RCC. The ""top down"" method of Rome is not validated by the church members. They appoint themselves, period. This is not the SDA method, and to equate their method with the present system in the SDA church is simply bogus.

For centuries, it was assumed that the call to priesthood was predicated on a simultaneous call to celibacy, and that the call to celibacy was binding equally and similarly on all candidates for priesthood, prescinding from sexual orientation. In these latter days, the Vatican has discerned a way to scapegoat homosexuals for the sex abuse crisis.The Instruction institutionalizes that hypocrisy. It creates a problem for all candidates for priesthood. The language of ""intrinsic disorder"" is not just wrong; it represents a dangerous and false understanding of human sexuality that will be troubling for any mature and healthy person contemplating priesthood.

In one case, teenagers were employed at a facility where several of these priests were housed. They mostly served as wait staff and when called upon this, the Church did stop employing kids at the facility. In another case, also in suburban Philadelphia, patients were free to take walks away from the facility. They were found to walk across the street to the parking lot of a high school and also to a nearby shopping center. One wonders if the Church will ever take this issue seriously.

I think your statement about a white power structure wanting Indians to just disappear totally is probably over the top.  I can agree that in the Westward expansion of the US, our collective approach to Indians and their lands was reprehensible.   That said however, the question is what do we do with that kind of thing today?  

One of the problems facing both parts of the middle east, and the Balkaans, is a desire by some to redress ancient wrongs.   I don't think mankind has ever found a way to do that effectively, and often when we try, we just replace one wrong with yet another.

6053225,This comment is cont. from comment below: so why does this report give a false impression about celibacy & homosexuality influencing child abuse in priests & refuses to state that having women priests & bishops would automatically lower future abuse rates simply because women have always abused less often and usually not sexually? Simple answer-These experts want married priests as they are ex-priests themselves & they don't care that this would not change any rate of abuse to children in our church because that does not get them what they want.  They themselves are sexist & don't really want ordained women priests so they use the Future Church mode of speech & say the church's lacking female authority & leadership roles? may have made abuse more likely.  Sexual abusers go to where there is best access & the least threat to be caught.  Children would likely tell a woman priest in their parish if their co-pastor was hurting them.

5389727,"As I said, 'the Church works exactly as the world works. That's the problem.' Of course, if it works in this way, then it will think in this way, too. How did Jesus put it? You think as men think, not as God thinks.

No, Jesus did not have to die, in the sense this was his incarnational mission. He came to live in loving obedience to his Father, for which the world would put him to death. The Father did not seek his son's death, yet knew that this would happen. God is a God of the living, not the dead. (Think it says this in one of the gospels, possibly Luke)

How can you even consider that God might approve the death penalty? 'Let he among you who is without sin be the first to cast a stone.' This is a universal condemnation of capital punishment.  And no, it doesn't mean I'm more sympathetic with murderers. That's silly.

They chose the nightclub shooting, with TWO reports, one being a video report.

Guess which shooting in Cincinnati is not being reported in the Globe and Mail?

Answer: The one where a white driver hit a little black child in a predominantly black neighbourhood and, in response, reports say multiple black male bystanders pulled out guns and shot the white driver to death.

The child who was hit by the car is doing fine, released from hospital the next day.

Hello?

You can bet that the Globe and Mail would have covered that second shooting HAD IT BEEN that the driver was a black man who hit a white child in a white neighbourhood and was then promptly shot dead by angry white bystanders.

That would be a top story at the CBC, Toronto Star and Globe and Mail, one can reasonably assume.

The LGBTQ rights movement has come a long way, but the struggle is far from over. LGBTQ youth still feel isolation, ostracism and fear and youth groups allow youth to feel like they are no longer alone. 

You write “But I draw the line at exposing my children to things that I believe are not morally right for me or them”. You believe youth who identify as LGBTQ, who know that they could be made homeless through parent’s intolerance, bullied, or killed for being LGBTQ shouldn’t know that there are safe spaces available to them because other youth might also get to learn about these safe spaces? 

There is also the increasingly long list of suicides which have been attributed to bullying https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicides_that_have_been_attributed_to_bullying.  These are youth who are dying because they feel isolated and hated, and remember that as you continue to try to take away a safe space that has been created for them.

I think his ""commands"" were very simple: Love God, Love your neighbor.  In all likelihood, all else was about examples of what that might mean. I think when we try to interpret Gospel stories as a ""command""  by Jesus, we miss the point.  The cost of that ""miss"" plays out in the hot button issues of our day.  I could imagine a very different position for a vibrant church today, for example, if the focus were on just those two commands, followed by good faith efforts to understand how those might apply to homosexuals, woman's ordination, the scandal, etc.

I agree that we have all the tools we need today. Can/will we use them?  I think there's a growing sense that if we are to use them, we'll have to find a place outside the church to do so.",1,1,1,0,0

If the ""African-American"" box is ticked on the application, the black automatically receives preference over any other race.
Call it ""black privilege"" if you will.

Is it the fault of whites that 70% of blacks are born out of wedlock, that about 30% of blacks fail to graduate from HS, that blacks endorse an anti-education culture of violent gangsta' hiphop, that black males commit over 60% of violent felonies, but make up less than 7% of the population?

If we don't want our stages to be a Whites-Only Zone, it makes sense to give a job to a singer of colour when that role is specifically written for a singer of colour. It will further that singer's career; inspire future singers of colour to say, ""Hey, I could do this""; and expose audiences to the talent of artists of colour, which can make people just a bit more imaginative and empathetic. (b) SOUTH PACIFIC is about a white woman who can't bear the thought of mixing the races. Race is a major plot point.

So when our church treats women less than men & strips them of their sacred rights to equal sacraments, it is an act of hatred & sin to do so, just as much as stripping a black man from his right to be a priest based on his skin color would be an act of hatred.  

We have sinned in the past.  Some our church's orders owned black slaves in America.  I will call hatred hate, and sexism is hatred.

There are important journalistic questions, too...

 Avoid descriptions that connote pity, such as afflicted with, suffers from or victim of. Rather, he has obsessive-compulsive disorder....

Thank you for writing this article. Of course, the identity of the Church's priests is a very important thing: they are first and foremost servants of God. What I can't understand, then, is why sexual orientation need be an important aspect of that priestly identity: you seem to agree, insofar as a man should not be turned away from seminary based on sexual orientation.

At the same time, would the irrelevance of sexual orientation in selecting priests not also carry over into the active lives of the priests? It is perfectly irrelevant that a man is attracted sexually to this or that category of people when that man is a priest. Hence, there is no meaningful classification of ""gay priests"" or ""straight priests"", but only priests as such. What good is to announce one's ""identity"" as a ""gay priest"" if that is irrelevant to his duties as a servant of God? That only exacerbates issues through the prism of identity politics and needless sensation.",1,1,0,0,0

The province where the attack occurred is the only  province to have introduced mandatory Islamic studies in the public school system; in effect, sacrificing gains made during the Quiet Revolution to accommodate the Religion of Peace, after denying the Catholic Church the right to interfere in the public education system. 

With the Supreme Court of Canada condoning the doing away with a secular public education to allow Islam to be taught to unbelievers' children  other provinces may follow with the same negative outcome.

In Utah, campus rape increased nearly 50 percent between 2012 and 2013. By contrast, sexual assaults nationwide have been decreasing each year by approximately 3 percent.

Actually, as I've said before on these boards, Natural Law simply needs to undergo a much-needed evolution when it comes to human sexual behavior. As it stands, it's stuck in the 13th century. Because Thomas Aquinas never himself observed animals of the same sex engaging in sexual behavior he deduced that same-sex behavior is ""against nature."" Since homosexuality is extant in every species of the animal kingdom it is clearly not ""against nature.""

It is part of a history of dehumanization, of denied citizenship, and efforts to rationalize, excuse, and justify state violence. From lynchings or mass incarceration, white supremacy has utilized dehumanization as part of its moral and legal justification for violence.

Conscience frequently errs from invincible ignorance without losing its dignity.

We are all capable of engaging in sex acts with both sexes, and we are all capable of being attracted to having sex with both sexes, regardless of which sexual attraction our pre-pubescent experiences might predispose us.

HomoSEXual, then, is a self-defined identity: a person who chooses to embrace his/her same-sex sexual attraction (because remember, we must love everyone) as his/her sole use of his/her sex organs with another person.

It is strange that you stereotype all Muslims into one group, a group that in your claim is 100 percent opposed to having theocratic rule over America. I would agree the vast majority do not want that, but I nonetheless find it striking that you feel comfortable to ignore diversity among Muslims and bunch them all together as 100 percent against theocracy. Your blanket statement is all the more strange when you consider that over a third of US Muslims want gay marriages banned for religious reasons, a greater proportion than white Catholics and about on the same level as black Protestants who want a ban on religious grounds. Too bad the facts are not on your side, I suppose.
