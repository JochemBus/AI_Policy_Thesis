In every field of technology,  commerce and trade, and jobs, the Chinese need the Americans much more than the Americans need the Chinese.

He can be ambiguous when speaking about Church teaching, tending more toward platitudes than clarity, and he's insensitive and awkward when speaking about women. 

On the plus side, he understands and articulates what's essential and urgent about the Church (mercy, solidarity with the poor and suffering, acting as Christ in the world) and what's excess baggage that should be jettisoned (triumphalism, cancerous clericalism, rigid legalism over compassion.)

Thank you for writing this article. Of course, the identity of the Church's priests is a very important thing: they are first and foremost servants of God. What I can't understand, then, is why sexual orientation need be an important aspect of that priestly identity: you seem to agree, insofar as a man should not be turned away from seminary based on sexual orientation.

At the same time, would the irrelevance of sexual orientation in selecting priests not also carry over into the active lives of the priests? It is perfectly irrelevant that a man is attracted sexually to this or that category of people when that man is a priest. Hence, there is no meaningful classification of ""gay priests"" or ""straight priests"", but only priests as such.

A teaching on the subject of faith or morals is magisterial if it has been universally and constantly taught by all of the Popes and the bishops in communion with them. This means universal in time as well as in place. What has been consistently taught since the time of the Apostles is not changeable.

A lot of people get confused about this. They think a thing is magisterial because the Pope says so, but really it's the other way around: Popes tend to say things that they know are magisterial teaching; because Popes are usually knowledgeable about Church teaching and committed to its promulgation. 

A magisterial teaching doesn't suddenly become unmagisterial just because a Pope is confused or forgets or misspeaks or has an inept translator. If one of those things happens, a bishop or theologian nearby is expected to call it to his attention.",0,0,0,0,0

I agree with you, but I might take it one step further here.  I think where the church has gotten itself tangled up is in the transition between how jesus lived, and the concept of ""commands"" of or by Jesus.

That's certainly true in college admissions, financial aid, government jobs, the military, and the corporate world.

Islam is a religion not a race fighting one will not necessarily reduce the other. Even if Islam was a race more knowledge about Islam may not lead to the desired results. 

The province where the attack occurred is the only  province to have introduced mandatory Islamic studies in the public school system; in effect, sacrificing gains made during the Quiet Revolution to accommodate the Religion of Peace, after denying the Catholic Church the right to interfere in the public education system. 

With the Supreme Court of Canada condoning the doing away with a secular public education to allow Islam to be taught to unbelievers' children  other provinces may follow with the same negative outcome.

They amplify one (actually more than one) of the main knocks on Trump himself: That he’s sloppy, erratic, in so many ways the opposite of the virtues he claims to embody. And, let’s not gloss over it, this is a depiction of a campaign—a campaign that nurtures white grievance and resentment—trying to profit off the work of a black woman, from an African American family that Trump and his supporters regularly belittle. The fact that the plagiarized text in question was about the value of hard work just makes matters worse. A mortifying, calamitous, self-immolating moment.""",1,0,0,1,0

Having done so and persuaded the person to have a change of heart, repent and be reintegrated into the life of the Church.  Does the Pope mean that if the person remains obdurate he ought not to be reintegrated? The alternative is to ignore the immorality and repentance and reintegrate.

* An opinion can also be defamatory depending on how it's worded. ""I think so-and-so is a pig,"" probably isn't libel. ""I think so-and-so is a pig because he rapes women,"" may be libel, unless the rape has been proven.

Catholics did not believe in personal interpretation of the Bible---so they can't be accused of doing that.  Nor were many Catholics educated enough to make any such teaching.  The Church itself didn't teach correctly.  That was why the Council of Trent, supposedly, was called into being.

And that is why the decrees were made in the late 20th and into the 21st Centuries.  If  the Catholic Church  already had a history of  DOING this---these decrees wouldn't have made much sense.",0,0,1,0,0

I like it. Two incidents in one day reported here on SF of people reacting to the encroaching menace of islam'.

First, the guy who tore up the koran, and now this warrior who defended American cultural norms.

 “the human mind can never discern ""absolute truth.""

Yes our interpretations will always be incomplete or I would rather say sufficient for the day, we are subject to the scrutiny of God’s Word, God is His own interpreter and over time will lead us into the Truth, we walk in darkness with His guiding light, His Living Word has to be lived (Absorbed) to fully understand it . 

To embrace Jesus is to devour His Word and we do this when we acknowledge His inviolate teaching within the heart and then His Word (Will) could be compared to “The Truth is a burning fire it looks not at man’s desire”

As we contemplate His Word (Will) the Holy Spirit, purifies (Burns) us, and in this knowing (Seeing) our true self/nature we see our own brokenness, in relation to His inviolate Word (Will) and when acknowledged openly will and does form a bond of trust (Unity of Purpose) based on humility, between Him and those who love Him.

Robertson has frequently blamed U.S. efforts to facilitate peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians as tampering with “God’s wrath.” In 2013, the televangelist told his audience that, “[F]rom a prophetic standpoint, every time the United States gets involved in some kind of a pressure on Israel to split their land, there’s some natural disaster that happens here in America.

There are many reasons why the medieval development of the altar as wall with a tabernacle as its center piece was not fortuitous. 

The most important has to do with our conception of the Eucharist as PRIMARILY (1) sacred food and drink, or (2) an object of adoration. 

The essence of Eucharist in scripture is sacred food. Jesus confected the Eurcharist at the Last Supper at the dinner table, and commanded us to both eat and drink. For most of the first thousand years, our churches faithfully conveyed that original divine intent with an altar that was instantly recognizable as a dinner table, to which bread and wine were brought, and from with the body and blood of Christ was distributed as sacred food and drink in the form of bread and wine. The original scriptural word that was adopted for a church building was ""ekklesia,"" which means ""gathering"" and which came to be understood as the ""place of gathering.""

What Ezekiel ben-Buzzi said over 2500 years ago was never meant to be cast in concrete advise for modern people. What he wrote, and his prophesies, refer to the times he lived in and have nothing to do with today.

You are entitled to your opinion and I support your right to speak your mind. But when you try to dictate how law is made in Alaska based on Biblical authority, which is speculative at best, you do nothing to advance your cause.

 If you call yourself a Christian then you probably ought to believe that the ministries of Jesus supersede all previous prophets and you should quote Him. Unfortunately you will find little support from the quotations of Jesus. He was big on tolerance and you are not.",0,0,1,0,0

5741636,"Gary, I agree, the odds of me identifying as a Christian are much higher because of where I was born.  But in my experience, those from the non-Christian areas of the world who do find Christ end up being the strongest followers of all, much like those who reject God and hit rock bottom before finding him.  Most who identify as Christians are really merely fans of team Jesus, and I’ll admit I sway that way sometimes too.  In fact, I think you are closer to God than the average guy who identifies as Christian because you are thinking about it and asking critical questions, whereas most will say they are Christian if you ask, but live their life with Jesus far from their minds.  I know you don’t like Bible quotes, but this one is so relevant to what I just said… Revelation 3:15-16:  I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!  So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth.  ,",0,0,1,0,0

(ii) When a solution is offered you take a cynical posture and just say that it's just P.R. (iii)You have a very simplistic view of how to solve a crisis like this in the first place. 

When you have a crisis like this that has been ingrained in the Catholic Church for 50 years going back to Pope John XXIII with his document ""Crimen sollicitationis""  as well as a crisis of a global nature, thinking that one man can just clean up that global crisis spanning 50 years in 3 or 4 years is nonsense. 

The tribunal episode shows how difficult it is because of the opposition the Pope faced over it. People like you cynically suggesting that the Pope just wants to cover it all up doesn't help the situation. Criticizing from the sidelines and offering no solutions doesn't solve the situation either and just makes your cynicism useless and counter productive.",1,0,1,0,0

Most Canadians understand and acknowledge that the indigenous file in Canada has been poorly handled by government after government and would welcome a path forward that would be equitable for all concerned. Most Canadians and their ancestors have supported the evolution of a society that is now the envy of most other nations. So what is balance? Perhaps this little misguided girl could have couched her remarks recognizing the strides our great nation has made to level the playing field - mostly the result of white people taking action (we are after all the majority so this should be no surprise) while also inserting that with all the progress made their is still considerable work to do.

This the second time in 18 months the children have endured her deadly driving. That's no surprise. This woman has serious mental problems along with alcoholism and the court allowed the children to be included in a plea deal. Well shame on those who encouraged that. These kids could have been injured or killed.  Yes acting out, she knows she has a severe drinking problem but when starting to drink chooses to not separate herself from the children, obey suspended license and endanger the entire community. She is much to high a risk to be in society. Having a severe problem with alcohol mixed with pathology does not make for a candidate for probation or any plea deal.",1,0,0,0,1

You seem to suggest that anyone opposed to kids playing football is somehow emasculating them.  Football is a ""manly"" sport and carries with it tremendous status for high school boys.  It's not surprising that over a million young men (and a few young women) play high school football each year.  

I would suggest that the possibility of lifelong brain damage from playing football far, far outweighs the possible emotional damage and sexual role identification issues from NOT playing football.  Additionally, of course, were there not football, these same kids would be playing other very active and, at the same time, less damaging sports....so their masculinity might still be saved (thank goodness)....(that's a little sarcasm at the end, by the way)   Gary Crum",1,0,0,0,0
