In every field of technology,  commerce and trade, and jobs, the Chinese need the Americans much more than the Americans need the Chinese.

 One thing I don't know about the transgender is about the hormones they take - do they have to take them daily? What happens to their physical and mental state if they have to go without them for a long time?

If a person is dependent on drugs to maintain physicality or mentality, generally they are not considered fit for military service.

He can be ambiguous when speaking about Church teaching, tending more toward platitudes than clarity, and he's insensitive and awkward when speaking about women. 

On the plus side, he understands and articulates what's essential and urgent about the Church (mercy, solidarity with the poor and suffering, acting as Christ in the world) and what's excess baggage that should be jettisoned (triumphalism, cancerous clericalism, rigid legalism over compassion.)

Thank you for writing this article. Of course, the identity of the Church's priests is a very important thing: they are first and foremost servants of God. What I can't understand, then, is why sexual orientation need be an important aspect of that priestly identity: you seem to agree, insofar as a man should not be turned away from seminary based on sexual orientation.

At the same time, would the irrelevance of sexual orientation in selecting priests not also carry over into the active lives of the priests? It is perfectly irrelevant that a man is attracted sexually to this or that category of people when that man is a priest. Hence, there is no meaningful classification of ""gay priests"" or ""straight priests"", but only priests as such.

A lot of people get confused about this. They think a thing is magisterial because the Pope says so, but really it's the other way around: Popes tend to say things that they know are magisterial teaching; because Popes are usually knowledgeable about Church teaching and committed to its promulgation.

Good news is that science will likely get us onside, for all the right reasons.  Within the next 25 years, electric cars will replace gasoline engines not because climate scientists say it must happen or governments legislate it, but because they reach the point that they are cleaner, faster, better, and cheaper to run and maintain.  Same with solar electrical generation vs coal.

We in the ""high"" church denominations certainly believe it is a sacrifice but one of praise and thanksgiving wherein we offer ourselves, our souls and bodies, imperfect as we are, to unite in the sacrament so that He may live in us and we in Him.

I agree with you, but I might take it one step further here.  I think where the church has gotten itself tangled up is in the transition between how jesus lived, and the concept of ""commands"" of or by Jesus.

Islam is a religion not a race fighting one will not necessarily reduce the other. Even if Islam was a race more knowledge about Islam may not lead to the desired results. 

The province where the attack occurred is the only  province to have introduced mandatory Islamic studies in the public school system; in effect, sacrificing gains made during the Quiet Revolution to accommodate the Religion of Peace, after denying the Catholic Church the right to interfere in the public education system. 

With the Supreme Court of Canada condoning the doing away with a secular public education to allow Islam to be taught to unbelievers' children  other provinces may follow with the same negative outcome.

I like it. Two incidents in one day reported here on SF of people reacting to the encroaching menace of islam'.

First, the guy who tore up the koran, and now this warrior who defended American cultural norms.

I understand that humans were bought in Africa, condemned to be transported and often killed in the the process, separated from kin, and beaten and sometimes worked to death. Nothing in that is inspirational, nothing in that says those who profited from the murderous activity deserve respect.Lots of people in prison do good things, but then they kill someone or kidnap someone.

There are many reasons why the medieval development of the altar as wall with a tabernacle as its center piece was not fortuitous. 

The most important has to do with our conception of the Eucharist as PRIMARILY (1) sacred food and drink, or (2) an object of adoration. 

The essence of Eucharist in scripture is sacred food. Jesus confected the Eurcharist at the Last Supper at the dinner table, and commanded us to both eat and drink. For most of the first thousand years, our churches faithfully conveyed that original divine intent with an altar that was instantly recognizable as a dinner table, to which bread and wine were brought, and from with the body and blood of Christ was distributed as sacred food and drink in the form of bread and wine.

It was really a mind-boggling ‚Äúleap into outer space‚Äù for Joseph to accept something so contrary to the belief of the entire world at that time: that human life could possibly be passed along only by that plenipotentiary ‚Äústaff of life‚Äù of the all-important patriarchal macho.  It was not until the year1827 that science demonstrated that the female has a 50/50% role in producing new functional human life. Before that date the female sexual apparatus was considered as nothing more than a handy natural incubator.  And so, logically, Pope PioNono in 1854 declared the ‚ÄúImmaculate Conception of Mary‚Äù as a dogma of faith.
