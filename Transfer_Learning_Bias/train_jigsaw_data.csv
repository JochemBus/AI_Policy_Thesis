In this case, it was a person who stopped being gay - which is the worst thing that can happen to the pro-gay movement, right? That's what I've noticed about the pro-gay movement the past 10 years. Pro-gays demand all the rights and privileges but deny any accountability. Part of the accountability is acknowledging there are people who don't agree with homosexuality. In summer 2012, a gay Nebraska woman called the cops and said she was assaulted in her home because she was gay. Investigation showed the injuries were self-inflicted. Pro-gay people in the area were asked about the incident and they said very, very little, because they knew the woman hurt their image.

It was widely speculated at the time, and Pope Benedict has since confirmed, that his inability to tame the Curia at least contributed to Benedict's decision to resign (see article referenced below). Pope John Paul II showed little interest in wrestling with the curial beast.  The ancient Roman axiom, ""Popes pass; the curia remains"" points to the intransigence of the curia.

""Myth No. 1. The alt-right is different from regular neo-Nazism. ... The alt-right is the same old hate, in other words, just with trendier packaging. ... if it salutes like a Nazi, you can safely call it one.""
...
""Myth No. 4. Trump doesn’t agree with what the alt-right stands for. ... Trump hasn’t specifically addressed the alt-right. He has never asked its members to stop photoshopping Jewish journalists into gas chambers in his honor. What’s more, he has often seemed to wink in their direction by deploying their rhetoric, with his talk of opposing “globalism,” his repeated retweets of alt-right Twitter accounts and his use of imagery — such as a Star of David illustration — that originated on Nazi websites.""",0,0,0,0,0

They don't use tactics like redlining to keep people of color (POC) out of their neighborhoods, towns, and cities, they use their money to drive the prices up so that all but a few  can ""mix in"". You see, members of the Upper Left Class (ULC) go to great lengths to show that they support POC, but since most POC are not upper class, members of the ULC would like those POC to live somewhere else. This is not new. When you have money you buy security, and that means distance from poorer people, but members of the ULC accuse those non-ULC of racism for doing exactly the same thing. Hypocrisy. Guilt. And, the ULC desperately needs the POC vote. What to do? Send your entitled brats into the street.

You do not understand basic Catholic belief.
You believe the Church is just another HUMAN organization, with decisions being made strictly on a natural basis, guided by -'flesh'.

The Church is guided by the HOLY SPIRT.
The Church has survived 2000 years, and is stronger than ever, in spite of 2000 years of persecution, misrepresentation and attacks.

Christ said to Peter: ""Upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it"" (Matt. 16:18).  

And you are wrong, it IS up to the hierarchy to determine or decide - through the guidance of the HOLY SPIRT - who is allowed to be called to any vocation.

That’s right. This actually happened and it happened because the Berkeley event was a platform that sought to use  ‘free speech’ as a means for expressing white supremacy. So yes it was vigorously protested by anti-fascists. It is entirely revealing of Wente’s fascistic inclinations that she would choose to overlook this fact in her defence of ‘free speech’. 

Here’s a thought that might offend the tender ears of those on the right who so vigorously defend free speech: the far right has constructed an entire fascist social movement around the notion of free speech.

So, the most obvious example of that would be that she became pregnant out of wedlock, and the Church fired her.  Another example could be that she was fired for overtly complaining (perhaps to her students) that she wanted to be a priest but the Church wouldn't let her, but I can't imagine a lawyer taking such a case as a gender-discrimination claim, because a man could have made the same complaint about the Church's teaching on women priests.  Maybe she was dressing with her cleavage showing, but that's a very weak gender claim too.

Mueller appears to have consumed a copious amount of the “density uber alles” Kool-Aid, and his sloppy attempt at a “folksy” style suggests some enrichment with CH3CH2O – “They are gonna come …”, “Au contraire,” “It just ain’t so,” “There you go again.” I’m surprised Mueller didn’t end his piece with “‘Nuff said.”

Consistent with his fellow “up, not out” true believers, Mueller provides us no facts and the most casual analysis reveals glaring inconsistencies.

Let’s start with “the greater good involves keeping our wonderful city within its current boundaries …” Exactly why are the current boundaries optimal? They were drawn under a radically smaller population and much different conditions in the southern Willamette Valley. True believers seem to treat the current UGB as some form of God-given demarcation; heaven on one side and hell on the other. An evidence-based analysis would very likely identify some areas to shrink and others to expand. ...",0,0,0,0,0

What is worse this time though is that there has been no word, absolutely none from the top administration to denounce this heresy.

Because Obama put China's aggression in the South China sea as a main agenda item after it became clear that China was only going to be mildly rebuked.  China did this as empty gesture to protest Obama not letting them dodge the issue.

In the crazy Obama derangement syndrome world of Charles Krauthammer, when the POTUS stands up to Chinese aggression in the South China Sea and makes it a main item at the G20 summit, and China reacts with a silly childish antic, he can only find fault with Obama.

Multiculturalism is when you can call a black man rude or unreasonable and even an a-hole and this is not seen the same as calling him a nigger.  Canadians should head things off by announcing that we, like most peoples , have some degree of racist DNA but that we do our best to keep it to a minimum.

They call their pastor ""Father"". The bible says call no man on earth father. Mathew 23:9. The bible also states you shall not add or take away from the bible, revelations 22 18 & 19.

I'm going to tell you a secret...don't share it with anyone!!!! The best, and I mean the very best, way to avoid abortions is to avoid unwanted pregnancies.  A second little secret: the best way to do that is to practice effective birth control.  

Men and women enjoy sex.  It's an integral part of marital and ""long-term"" relationships.  Effective birth control allows such sexual relations w/o the risk of that ""unintended pregnancy.""  Please explain why that is NOT a desirable thing.  Thanks, Gary Crum",1,0,0,0,0

Of course, a similar incident, i.e., of kicking an excellent religion teacher to the curb because of her homosexual relationship, occurred at Waldron Mercy Academy in June 2015.

The matter is a person that has that condition [and] that has good will because they search for God, who are we to judge them? We must accompany well -- what the Catechism says.

The CDF only agreed to laicised one. This makes a mockery of Francis’ claim that the Church has a zero tolerance policy. The Church has a zero tolerance policy for priests who have committed no crime but want to marry – they have to be laicised and not just have some restrictions on their public ministry.

The EC is an old device put into the constitution to allow Southern states to have presidents elected. That includes Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, all slave owners. The Constitution gave each slave 3/5ths of a human existence in counting for representation in the EC, even though none could vote in a presidential election.

Why is it prejudiced to say that there are women who choose to carry their babies to term even when they have been raped? Some women do see a connection between themselves and that child growing in their womb. I never said that all women feel this way. I am just saying that turning to Jesus and trusting in His grace (that He gives to those who humbly approach Him) to help them deal with even the most difficult of situations (whether that be being married and pregnant but fearful of not being financially capable of raising the child, becoming pregnant through a one night stand or being the victim of rape or incest)! With God, Mark all things are possible. Mark, I do believe that abortion destroys God's creation. God created man and then created the fish in the sea and the animals but He gave man dominion of the fish in the sea and the animals. He gave us fish and meat to eat.

Francis seems to hold that the sensus fidelium is a relevant factor in the process. Others seem to point out that infallibility refers only to doctrinal pronouncements addressed to all the faithful, not to approval or disapproval of conduct by individuals.

Red-lining, which occurred until the 1950s and prevented people of color from buying homes in certain neighborhoods, has left a legacy where inherited wealth skews overwhelmingly to whites. And let's not forget about Vanport (which almost everyone has). The point is that racial discrimination is never a thing of the past. It's not a problem we've solved, and now let's just get over it.

Simple answer-These experts want married priests as they are ex-priests themselves & they don't care that this would not change any rate of abuse to children in our church because that does not get them what they want.  They themselves are sexist & don't really want ordained women priests so they use the Future Church mode of speech & say the church's lacking female authority & leadership roles? may have made abuse more likely.  Sexual abusers go to where there is best access & the least threat to be caught.  Children would likely tell a woman priest in their parish if their co-pastor was hurting them.

A heterosexual person who acts out their attractions would also be bared from entering seminary--because such a person does not demonstrate an ability to live celibacy and chastely.  

Secondly: is it a news flash that the Church does not support the gay lifestyle?  Why are you surprised to hear the pope reiterate church teaching on this issue?

Dying is is a series of shut-downs and can sometimes be reversed before the actual final closure. Therefore, a recovery is not a ""return-from-the-dead"" ... because the death never occurred.

It's pretty much impossible to participate in a same-sex wedding and not be seen as approving of the lifestyle it symbolizes. In participating, Christians not only negate their own witness in all other areas of morality, but they also hold the entire gospel up to ridicule. Why should anyone believe our faith message if our lifestyles are steeped in sin? The idea that we're not guilty of sin when we only condone it and are to doing the actual deed is a compromise with sin that you will not find anywhere in Scripture.",0,0,1,0,0

Regarding Japanese people, our Korean microwave engineer, probably my best friend over there, once told me while we were on a train to HQ from the boonies to Taejon, that if he saw a Japanese person on the train he would throw the man off. This was about twenty years after the war and Korean liberation from Japanese occupation, and this Korean was still fiercely resentful, with good reason. Their women were kidnapped and used as sex slaves. Even if you can prove some Neolithic connection of Han people to Mongols or Chinese, that is immaterial when considering Korean sensibilities. That's just common sense.

Koreans well know that China invaded Korea after the Japanese left, and divided their country, tearing families apart. Why should Korea like China? China and Mongolia had invaded Korea numerous times, long before Europeans had ventured across the Atlantic. The independent kingdoms in Korea predated Christianity",1,0,1,1,0

You are right about civil marriage for gays. At least no one is blathering about civil unions anymore. Still, the Church should take an interest in gay marriage because, as Judaism teaches, marriage is the union between two families. The genitals of those prompting the joining are not imporant and the Church promoting monogamous unions in Christ is a positive good. Get over the Stoic argument about the ends of sex.
